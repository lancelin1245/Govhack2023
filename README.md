# Explore the relationship between vehicle types and the uptake of EVs
In the GovHack 2023 competition, our team of three swiftly analysed vehicle registration data sponsored by the Department of Government Services (Victoria) within a tight 46-hour timeframe. 

Our primary focus was unravelling the relationship between vehicle types and Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption, culminating in the proposal of the "WattSpy" app that aims to play a crucial role in addressing the evolving EV landscape by introducing features such as price comparison, enabling users to evaluate charging costs across stations. 

In recognition of our collective efforts, we were honoured as runners-up for the project.
